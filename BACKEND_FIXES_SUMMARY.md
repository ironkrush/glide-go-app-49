# 🎉 Backend Issues Resolved - Lankadhish Email System

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **HTML Validation Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `<head>` tag incorrectly placed in Contact.tsx causing DOM nesting warnings
```
Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <head> cannot appear as a child of <div>
```

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Replaced `<head>` with `<Helmet>` component
- ✅ Added proper import for `react-helmet-async`
- ✅ Fixed DOM structure validation

### 2. **Email Service Configuration Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Email service was using placeholder access key instead of actual Web3Forms key
```
Failed to send booking email: Error: Failed to send email
```

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated `emailService.ts` to import configuration from `email.ts`
- ✅ Connected to actual Web3Forms access key: `8bd07088-978b-43fe-bf85-c50508f825ea`
- ✅ Configured proper recipient email: `krush2752@gmail.com`

# Email Setup Instructions for RideEasy

## Current Issue
The current email setup is configured to use Resend with a test account that only allows sending emails to the verified email address (inffycompany@gmail.com). To send emails to krush2752@gmail.com, you need to either:

## Option 1: Verify Domain with Resend (Recommended)
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add and verify your domain
3. Update the `from` address in the email function to use your verified domain
4. Change the `to` address back to `krush2752@gmail.com`

## Option 2: Use Gmail SMTP (Alternative)
1. Set up Gmail App Password for krush2752@gmail.com
2. Update the Supabase function to use Gmail SMTP instead of Resend
3. This requires updating the email sending logic

## Option 3: Email Forwarding (Current Temporary Solution)
- Emails are currently sent to inffycompany@gmail.com
- The email includes a note to forward to krush2752@gmail.com
- This is a temporary workaround until proper domain verification

## Current Email Features
✅ Professional HTML email template with proper styling
✅ All booking details included with proper formatting
✅ Customer information clearly displayed
✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
✅ Urgent priority indicators
✅ Proper timezone handling (IST)

## Next Steps
1. Choose one of the options above
2. Update the email configuration accordingly
3. Test the email functionality
4. Verify emails are received at krush2752@gmail.com

## Testing
The email functionality has been tested and works correctly. The only limitation is the recipient email address due to Resend's verification requirements.
